The repair of the marble fountains, which had lost their bronze statuary to vandals and thieves, was part of a $2.4 million, seven-year project that also restored the Italian Renaissance and classic French gardens. The Elms, a 14-acre estate on Bellevue Avenue, was built for Edwin J. Berwind, a Philadelphia coal magnate. The limestone mansion was saved from certain demolition and development in 1962 by Mrs. George Henry Warren, founder of the Preservation Society of Newport County, which had previously been dedicated to saving Colonial houses. When she heard that the Elms had been sold to real estate developers for $135,000, Mrs. Warren stepped in, and with the help of 57 backers, persuaded the new owners to sell most of the estate to the society for $75,000. (The deal allowed the developers to retain three large Victorian guesthouses on an adjacent street.) The mansion was opened to the public less than a month later, thanks to the speed at which Mrs. John Nicholas Brown and her committee refurnished the house with loans from many sources, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art and gifts from residents of the Newport summer colony, some of whom gave important pieces they had just bought at the auction of the mansion's contents.
