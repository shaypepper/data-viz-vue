# Interactive Data Visualization - Spring 2020

## Exploratory Project - Bill Cunningham in the Evening Hours

I wanted to understand more about Bill Cunningham's work ethic. From documentaries and reading about him, I knew he was prolific. I wanted to visualize that. Pulling his columns from 15 years of covering NYC society, I was able to parse out every event that he went to (and wrote about). Then, I mapped those events and created a filter using a bar chart showing the number of events he went to per column.

## Explanatory Project - Inspiration from The Upshot

Who among us doesn't enjoy reading The Upshot? It's a column intended to make some of the most confusing topics more understandable for your everyday reader. For this project I did a meta-visualization. I have a series of waffle charts to show the common characteristics of data visualizations in The Upshot. This include chart type, interaction types, and color use. Additionally, I wanted to show the breadth of coverage. For this I used a bar chart in the form of a wheel more to show the vast number of topics than the number of stories for any given topic.
